__hash table__ **data structure**

In computing, a hash table, also known as hash map, is a data structure that implements an associative array or dictionary, an abstract data type that maps keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found.

A hash table provides constant time data retrieval at best and average cases.
At worse case, a hash table can become a linked list, which will provide linear time data retrieval.
