## 📔 About C 📔
C is a general-purpose programming language that is extremely popular, simple, and flexible to use. It is a structured programming language that is machine-independent and extensively used to write various applications, Operating Systems like Windows, and many other complex programs like Oracle database, Git, Python interpreter, and more.

🖊 C was created by Dennis Ritchie ath Bell Laboratories in 1972.It was created from ‘ALGOL’, ‘BCPL’ and ‘B’ programming languages, and has all features from these languages and many more.

It is said that ‘C’ is a god’s programming language. One can say, C is a base for the programming. If you know ‘C,’ you can easily grasp the knowledge of the other programming languages that uses the concept of ‘C’

Most of the theories related to computers like Computer Networks, Compiler Designing, Computer Architecture, Operating Systems are based on C programming language and requires a good knowledge of C programming if you are working on them. In the modern high level languages, the machine level details are hidden from the user, so in order to work with CPU cache, memory, network adapters, learning C programming is a must.

It is essential to have a background in computer memory mechanisms because it is an important aspect when dealing with the C programming language.

C was mainly developed as a system programming language to write operating system. The main features of C language include low-level access to memory, simple set of keywords, and clean style, these features make C language suitable for system programming like operating system or compiler development.

Today Microsoft windows, Android, iOS, MacOS, Linux, raspberry Pi, etc. are the major Operating systems running billions of devices world wide. All these OS have one thing in common. They are all written mostly in 🔥C, with some parts in assembly language.

C is a Middle-Level Language. The middle-level languages are somewhere between the Low-level machine understandable assembly languages and High-Level user friendly languages. Being a middle-level language, C reduces the gap between the low-level and high-level languages.

C is extensively used in Embedded Programming. Embedded Programming is also referred to as micro-controller programming, where C program is used to control micro-controllers. Microcontrollers and embedded programming is widely used in auto-motives, Robotics, Hardware etc.

## ⭐️ C is __Awesome__ because ⭐️

<i>
👨‍🏫 C is one of the best languages to learn fundamental computer science concepts

💻 C is the coding language choice for system programming

🚢 Portability: C has a very small runtime and has absolutely no runtime dependencies. In C, low-level memory resources can be accessed directly and effortlessly.

🚀 C is very fast in terms of execution time.

🖥 C can be used for writing operating systems as well as doing application level programming.
